# Breaking changes

### Breaking changes from history version to latest version:

## #1

```javascript
mermaid.initialize({
    sequenceDiagram:{
        ...
    }
})
```

has been changed to

```javascript
mermaid.initialize({
    sequence:{
        ...
    }
})
```

## #2

In old versions you needed to reference a CSS file in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mermaid.min.css" />
```

or

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mermaid.forest.min.css" />
```

Now it is not needed, and there are no more CSS files in the distribution files.

You just:

```javascript
mermaid.initialize({
  theme: 'forest',
});
```

and it works like a charm because now the CSS is inline with the SVG to allow simpler portability.
