# Accessibility Options

## Accessibility

Now with Mermaid library in much wider use, we have started to work towards more accessible features, based on the feedback from the community.

To begin with, we have added a new feature to Mermaid library, which is to support accessibility options, **Accessibility Title** and **Accessibility Description**.

This support for accessibility options is available for all the diagrams/chart types. Also, we have tired to keep the same format for the accessibility options, so that it is easy to understand and maintain.

## Defining Accessibility Options

### Single line accessibility values

The diagram authors can now add the accessibility options in the diagram definition, using the `accTitle` and `accDescr` keywords, where each keyword is followed by `:` and the string value for title and description like:

- `accTitle: "Your Accessibility Title"` or
- `accDescr: "Your Accessibility Description"`

**When these two options are defined, they will add a coressponding `<title>` and `<desc>` tag in the SVG.**

Let us take a look at the following example with a flowchart diagram:

```mermaid-example
   graph LR
      accTitle: Big decisions
      accDescr: Flow chart of the decision making process
      A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
      B --> C{Decision}
      C -->|One| D[Result 1]

```

```mermaid
   graph LR
      accTitle: Big decisions
      accDescr: Flow chart of the decision making process
      A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
      B --> C{Decision}
      C -->|One| D[Result 1]

```

See in the code snippet above, the `accTitle` and `accDescr` are defined in the diagram definition. They result in the following tags in SVG code:

### Multi-line Accessibility title/description

You can also define the accessibility options in a multi-line format, where the keyword is followed by opening curly bracket `{` and then multiple lines, followed by a closing `}`.

`accTitle: My single line title value` (**_single line format_**)

vs

`accDescr: { My multi-line description of the diagram }` (**_multi-line format_**)

Let us look at it in the following example, with same flowchart:

```mermaid-example
   graph LR
      accTitle: Big decisions

      accDescr {
        My multi-line description
        of the diagram
      }

      A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
      B --> C{Decision}
      C -->|One| D[Result 1]

```

```mermaid
   graph LR
      accTitle: Big decisions

      accDescr {
        My multi-line description
        of the diagram
      }

      A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
      B --> C{Decision}
      C -->|One| D[Result 1]

```

See in the code snippet above, the `accTitle` and `accDescr` are defined in the diagram definition. They result in the following tags in SVG code:
